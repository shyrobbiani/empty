An empty project to edit my **markdowns**

I've been looking for a **markdown** editor and this comes in handy :smile: 

I simply work in MARKDOWN.md and copy the content over to where it's needed (cut & paste).

Simple, like Go, the programming language :wink:

You dont know what **markdown** is?

Take a look here: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown
